<h1> Beach </h1>

<p> In my free time, I love going to the beach. San Diego beaches are some of the best in the world! My favorite beach is Del Mar. There, I like to surf, walk on the beach, and play with friends.
<h1> Studying </h1>

<p> In addition, I love studying. I not only find it exremely beneficial for rasing my grade in a certain class, but even find it enjoyable, especially when I get to learn something new in a subject like math or science.
