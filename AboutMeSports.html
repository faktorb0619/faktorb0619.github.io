<p> My favorite football team is the Patriots. I have always been  fan since I knew what football was. Additionally, if I had to live anywhere in the world (but San Diego), I would live in Boston. My favorite player from the team is Edelman, who is a wide reciever. I am always amazed how he manages to catch the ball and land two feet in right before going out of bounds. All of the players have their own strenghts, and together, they kick butt!
<h2> Julian Edelman: </h2>

<p> Julian Edelman is one of the most skilled players playing for the Patriots. Without him, the team would not be what they are today. He always astonishes me with his inrcedible catches!
<h2> Tom Brady </h2>

<p> Tom Brady is deafinately the star of the Patriots. No matter how much pressure he's under, no matter how far behind his team is, he always pulls through to make some of the most brilliant plays ever. 
<p>

<h2> Accomplishments: </h2>
<p> Tom Brady has gone to 7 superbowls and won 4 of them. The Patriots joined the NFL in 1970. They hold the world record for most wins in 10 years (126), had an undefeated regular season in 2007, and have a total of 5 superbowl wins since 2002.
