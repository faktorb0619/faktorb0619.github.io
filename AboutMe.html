<p> I personally have always been made at awe by math. Its incredible applications to physics and nature astound me. For many, it is difficult to appreciate the beauty of certain formulas, and I want to be able to appreciate each one. To me, math is truly inspiring.</p>

<p> I love following football, and even love making a few dollars on bets. My favorite sports team, since I was old enough to understand what football was, was the Patriots. I find anyone who dares to oppose the Patriots, either by facing them in a simple match or creating conspiracies (Deflate Gate) my personal enemy.
