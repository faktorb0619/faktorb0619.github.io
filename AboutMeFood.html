<p> One of my favorite foods has to be steak. It is also my favorite thing to cook, whenever I'm allowed to. I personally like my steaks somewhere in betweeen Rare and Medium. My favorite way to season a steak is with salt, pepper, rosemary, grlic, and butter. Yum!</p>
<h1> Potatoes:</h1>

<p> I also love potatoes. Not only do they pair incredibly well with steak, but they can be served and cooked in a variety of ways. They can be mashed, baked whole, baked cut, fried, steamed, and more. I like my potatoes with salt, pepper, and herbs. My favorite way of cooking potatoes is roasting small pieces.
<h1> Chinese Food: </h1>

<p> I, like 7 billion people, love food. I, however, probably love chinese food too much. My favorite food is Chinese food, namely takeout and leftovers. My favorite dishes include Broccoli Beef and soup dumplings.
