<h1> My Future Career: </h1>
<img src="http://physicslocker.com/physicslocker/images/physics.jpg" alt="Doing Math Image" style="width:700px;height:400px;">
<p> I have always loved physics. That's why I want to become a physicist. It's math, but applied in incredible ways! It can be in the form of physics on a molecular level, mechanical physics, quantum physics, and list goes on! I love the satisfaction of solving a problem that could appear in real life and solving exactly and mathematically and applying that idea to the world around me.
<h2> How to Achieve the Career: </h2>
1. Graduate High School with a published article and at least a 4.3 GPA. 
2. Get accepted into the California Institute of Technology.
3. Get a job as a physicist in a university or for a big company.
4. Sip wine with my wife staring at the sunset over the cliff on which our house will be on.
