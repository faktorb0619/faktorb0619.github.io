<p> I have always loved physics. That's why I want to become a physicist. It's math, but applied in incredible ways! It can be in the form of physics on a molecular level, mechanical physics, quantum physics, and list goes on! I love the satisfaction of solving a problem that could appear in real life and solving exactly and mathematically and applying that idea to the world around me.
<h2> How to Achieve the Career: </h2>
<p>1. Graduate High School with a published article and at least a 4.3 GPA.</p>
<p>2. Get accepted into the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>3. Get a job as a physicist in a university or for a big company.</p>
<p>4. Sip wine with my wife staring at the sunset over the cliff on which our house will be on.</p>
